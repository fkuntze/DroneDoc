== Introduction

This book is a work in progress describing our experience replicating the Flone drone.

There is a lot of working being done in the drone community and things can evolve very quickly.  The information in this book is a snapshot of the work done to build a Flone drone.  The version of the Flone built in this book should be considered a Flone v1.0 with some slight modifications.

The modifications made to the original Flone design include the following:

COMMS:: Due to time constraints, a common RC transceiver set was used bypassing the phone guidance system.
PDU:: The original power distribution unit was replaced by a commercially available version.

The reasons for these changes will be explained in the relevant sections of this document.  These changes had no significant effect on the construction process and the user can judge for themselves whether these changes are appropriate for their context.

This book is based in part on the original instructions available on the internet in both the  http://wiki.flone.cc/index.php[Flone Wiki] and the http://flone.aeracoop.net/[Flone Site].  Both these sites are almost exclusively in spanish which makes this book all the more useful for those of us whose linguistic skills do not include that language.

The definitive source for all information on the Flone project is Lots Amarros and his team who designed and built the Flone and continuing making improvements to the design.  Any questions about the project should be addressed to Lots and his team.

For more information on the information presented in this book, feel free to send me an email and I will do my best to respond.
