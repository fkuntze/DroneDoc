== Components

This chapter provides a cursory overview of all the elements involved in building a drone and in particular the Flone.  Drones are not all alike but the vast majority will have pieces that are listed in this chapter.  There is some functionality that is not included notably FPV and navigation as they are not part of the original design.

=== Summary

Hopefully, this section has provided an overview of all the components required to build the Flone.  You should be able to identify all the pieces and understand what purpose they serve in the overall design.  The next sections will describe each element in detail, assembly and how it all fits together.
