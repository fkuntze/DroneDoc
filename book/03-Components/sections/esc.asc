=== Electronic Speed Controller

The electronic speed controller (ESC) is a microcontroller which regulates the flow of current to the motors thereby modifying the speed.  In a rotary wing drone, speed control is the primary and only method to control the flight envelope of the vehicle.  An ESC while technically complex does not actually control the flight of the drone by acts on the directives supplied by the flight controller.
