=== Communications

The Flone project does not integrate an autopilot but instead requires input from the user to control its position.  This is achieved through a radio frequency link between a ground station and the drone.  The original Flone project uses the Wifi connection between two smart phones to achieve this communication.  In this book, a traditional RC link will be discussed.
