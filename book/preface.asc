== Preface by Frithjof Kuntze

This book is an effort to capture all the details of building a drone using the materials in most Fablabs.  There's still a lot going on in this space so stay tuned and I hope this book will continue to be expanded by others as more experience is collected and lessons are learned about improving an already great design.

I don't take any credit for the Flone or its design.  This is the brainchild of Lots Amarros and credit is due to him and his team for creating such an accessible piece of technology.  If you want to help further the efforts of Lot et al, please contact him directly.

== Dedications

This book is dedicated to the Makers, Fablabs, Inventors, Dreamers and all the other folks that not only come up with these great ideas but actually make them fly.
