== Safety Considerations

Safety is very important whenever you are working with DIY drones.  Commercial manufacturers spend lots of time and money thinking of how people might hurt themselves and then take steps to mitigate those risks.

But since you are building your own drone, safety is your responsibility.  Not only your safety but also those that might be present when you are working or flying your drone.  In this document, areas of particular risk will be highlighted as follows:

WARNING: Pay attention when doing this since it could be potentially dangerous to you or people near you.

These risks you should not ignore!  These are things that could potentially cause grievous bodily harm, create an explosion or fire hazard or potentially get you arrested.  You have been warned...

The next class of risk are cautions which are things you need to pay special attention to since it may cause irrevocable damage to your work.

CAUTION: Be careful doing this or you may need to replace the part your working on since it may become an expensive and very small paperweight.

The class describes something you should be extra careful when doing since it is easy to overlook and doing it right the first time may save you hours of debugging later.  Don't ask me how I know!?

IMPORTANT: Pay attention to this step because commenting/uncommenting this one line of code will make all the difference in flight performance.

Then there are just things that need your attention because they are interesting or worth paying attention to and since you are in such hurry you to finish you won't pay attention until something doesn't work and I can't be there to say 'I told you so!'.

NOTE: You can do this way but it is the long and arduous way.

TIP: If you spend the few extra dollars to buy this tool your life will be much easier.

Finally, there is one tool that is very inexpensive, available to everyone but people - especially younger people - don't use often enough.  It will help avoid many mistakes, injuries, frustration, failed marriages and long sleepless nights.  It's referred to as "common sense".  Use it frequently.
